                            really good happens to you.
                            I hope your heart becomes so full of happiness that it heals all the parts
                            of you that once felt hurt.
                            Keep yourself reminding of this, you are loved and worthy even when it doesn't feel that way.
                            It’s been so long since I last seen you. I haven’t heard from you in a while.This doesn’t really mean anything. I stalked you last time, I know you probably noticed
